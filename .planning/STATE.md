# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-29)

**Core value:** Reliable, simple, debuggable access to OmniFocus data for AI agents -- executive function infrastructure that works at 7:30am.
**Current focus:** Phase 34 — contracts-and-query-foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 35
Plan: Not started
Status: Phase complete — ready for verification
Last activity: 2026-03-29

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 10%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 1 (this milestone)
- Cumulative: 103 plans across v1.0-v1.3

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Recent decisions affecting current work:

- No standalone count tools — total_count embedded in ListResult
- Query models inherit QueryModel (not CommandModel) — read-side taxonomy
- Service resolves all shorthands before repository layer — prevents SQL/in-memory drift
- Bridge fallback parity is a hard requirement — cross-path equivalence tests mandatory
- [Phase 34]: StrictModel extracted as shared base for CommandModel/QueryModel; Query suffix added to contract naming convention
- [Phase 34]: ListResult inherits OmniFocusBaseModel (not StrictModel) since it is an output model
- [Phase 34]: Availability clauses use static lookup dicts (no user params) -- column-only SQL conditions avoid injection surface
- [Phase 34]: SqlQuery NamedTuple as standard return type for parameterized SQL in repository layer

### Pending Todos

Carried forward:

1. Add retry logic for OmniFocus bridge timeouts (v1.6)
2. Investigate macOS App Nap impact on OmniFocus responsiveness (v1.6)
3. Make UAT folder discoverable for verification agents
4. Investigate `replace: []` bug in production (may not be staleness-related)
5. Remove misleading "single runtime dependency" messaging from README + landing page
6. Migrate write tools to typed params with validation middleware (Approach 1 from fastmcp-middleware-validation research)

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet.
